# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

#software engineering refers to Systematic application of engineering principles to design, development, testing and maintenance of software.This ensures applications are reliable, secure and meet user needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

#The birth of software engineering..The term was coined at a NATO conference to address software crisis.
#Introduction of Object-oriented programming..the languages like c++ and java allowed developers to build complex systems.
#Formulation of the Agile Manifesto..revolutionised software by shifting the focus from documentation to delivering working software quickly.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

#Requirement gathering...this is mainly to understand the needs of yhe software from stakeholders.
#Design.. planning the architecture,user interface and system components.
#Implementation...this is where the actual code is written based on the design that was created.
#Testing.. finding bugs to ensure it works as intended.
#Deployment..this phase is where the system is released to users.
#Maintainance.. fixing and updating features to ensure the software is relevant.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

#waterfall is the linear step by step approach where each phase is completed before going on to another.Best for projects that require well defined requirements.i.e launching a satellite.
#Agile is an iterative approach where work is done in small increments allowing for frequent feedback and adjustments.suitable where requirements might evolve. i.e a startup product.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
#Developer is responsible for writing code, building features and solves technical problems.
#Quality Assurance is responsible for testing the software to find bugs and ensure quality standards of the software.
#Project manager oversees the project,manages timeline, resources and communication.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

#IDE makes coding sessions easier by providing features like syntax highlighting, debugging and auto completion.example include visual studio.
#version controls track changes to code eg. git.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
#requirement change..make use of agile solutions 
#tight deadline.. break to smaller chunks and prioritize the tasks.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
#unit testing refer to testing the single component to ensure its  working as intended.
#intergrated testing is testing done to ensure components interactions work as they are supposed to after integrating.
#system is where the system is tested as a whole unit .
# acceptance is where the system is tested on how the user manages to use the software.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
#refers to creating effective inputs to get the desired output from AI models.this models need clear, specific instructions to produce useful results.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
#vague ..tell me about technology 
#better.. explain the causes and effects of technology on transportation.
this is better as the prompt is specific,concise and creates the boundaries of where the prompt should major.
